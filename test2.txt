Steps to add a file to the repository
    create the file u want to add 
    then "git add <filename>" to add this file to staging area
    then "git commit -m "message to be displayed" 
    then "git push origin <branch: main>"
    
Steps to pull any changes made in the repo online:
    "git pull" this will pull all the new changes made in the repo


Steps to make a local folder a git repository:
    create the folder u want make into a git repo
    use "git init" to add the git folder (hidden)
    now create all the files u want to inside the folder as usuall
    then use "git add ." to add all the changes to the git
    then use "git commit -m 'message to be displayed'"

    in your github account online create a repository with same name
    then "git remote add origin <repo link>" to connect to the repo online 

    Now there is no branch in the repo so u need to change that
    always u start with the master branch u can directly push into master by "git push origin master"
    or u can change the name of the branch to main by "git branch -M main"


Steps to change branches :
    git checkout <branchname>
